                        My name is Nneka Tielman, (<em> feel free to call me Nika, as many people struggle to pronounce the name </em>). I'm a full-stack developer with an art &amp; design background, currently residing in The Hague.
                    </p>

                    <br />

                    <p>
                        <strong>I enjoy working with:</strong><em> React, JavaScript,</em> and <em>Python</em>
                        <br />
                        <strong>Currently learning:</strong><em> GSAP, Three.js</em>

                    <p>
                        Coming from a creative background taught me to carefully consider my audience and what experience I intend for them to have through my work. The projects I'm most passionate to work on are undoubtedly front-end, especially where I get the opportunity to tell a story through UI effects, animations, and creating a dynamic user experience.
                    </p>
